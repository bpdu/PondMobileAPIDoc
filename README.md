# Pond Mobile API v.2.1 Reference 

This repository contains [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) descriptions of [Pond Mobile API v.2.1](https://api.pondmobile.com/v.2.1).

## What is Pond Mobile API?

The Pond Mobile API allows users to get the list of SIM cards, retrieve inventory, group and template information, register a SIM transfer, control a packet and traffic policy on a specific SIM, assign wallet and whitelists, apply some security profiles and send SMS. 

## What is OpenAPI specification?

From the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification):

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

In this document we used [OpenAPI v.3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html).
