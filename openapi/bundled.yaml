      description: The endpoint returns a list of all 'Package Templates' currently available. These templates are blueprints for creating SIM data, voice, or SMS plans, known as 'Packages.' The returned list provides an easy overview of all the template options, including their service allowances, durations, sales and activation windows, applied traffic policies, names, and activation methods. You can use these templates as a starting point for generating one or more packages for a SIM via other endpoints.

      summary: Create a new package template.
      description: The endpoint allows you to create a package template. A package template is a blueprint for creating SIM data, voice, or SMS plans, also known as packages. When creating a template, you can define several parameters including the service allowance, duration, sales and activation window, traffic policy to be applied, the template name, and the activation method. Once a template is established, you can use it to generate one or more packages for a SIM via other endpoints. The network services available to the SIM are defined by these packages.

This configuration is determined by the "Wallet Mode" setting in the SIM's Policy and Charging Rules (PCR) profile.  The wallet provides flexibility in managing and distributing funds within the group. It can be used to achieve a pooled balance where the usage charges of all SIMs in the group contribute to and draw from a shared balance.
